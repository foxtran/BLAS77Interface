# BLAS77Interface

Fortran 90 modules and wrappers for BLAS &amp; LAPACK routines.

The idea is to get all interfaces for BLAS/LAPACK routines into Fortran modules for:
1. safely usage
2. possible masking of BLAS/LAPACK symbols

Library provides one main module `blas77lapack77` with all known BLAS+LAPACK routines and `blas77` and `lapack77` modules for BLAS and LAPACK routines, respectively.

# Usage

Currently, library can be used only with [CMake build system](https://cmake.org), or manually.

To use `BLAS77Interface` in your project, you have to fetch library:
```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(BLAS77Interface
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/foxtran/BLAS77Interface.git
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(BLAS77Interface)
```

After this, you can link the library with your Fortran application:
```cmake
target_link_libraries(<TARGET> PUBLIC BLAS77Interface)
```

Useful flags that changes behaviour of library:
- `BLAS77Interface_ENABLE_LAPACK` enables LAPACK interfaces (default: ON)
- `BLAS77Interface_BLA_SIZEOF_INTEGER` changes default BLAS integer size in bytes (default: 4)

The variables should be set before fetching.

# Source code generation

BLAS77Interface uses [Reference LAPACK](https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack) for generation its code. Latest commit is used.

Generation consists from several stages:
1. Extracting API of non-auxiliary functions of BLAS and LAPACK.
2. Using API, generate corresponding blas77 and lapack77 modules.
3. Using API, generate corresponding ubblas and ublapack wrappers.
4. Apply patches for special cases.

# Known issues

1. LAPACK auxiliary routines are missing
2. LAPACK routines with EXTERNAL procedures are omitted
3. ubwrappers are not yet available
4. Only CMake build is available
5. Limited set of compilers is supported
